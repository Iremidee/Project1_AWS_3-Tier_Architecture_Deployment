# Project1_AWS_3-Tier_Architecture_Deployment
## Architecture Overview
This project is a guide for the process of creating a robust infrastructure consisting of a web tier, application tier, and database tier, leveraging various AWS resources to ensure high availability, security, and performance.
## Project Outline
In this documentation, I will set up and deploy a three tier architecture using AWS. The architecture includes:
* The First Tier (Web Tier): The public subnet which holds the Application Load Balancer.
* The Second Tier (App Tier): The private subnet which holds the web servers such as EC2 Instance.
* The Third Tier (Database Tier): The private subnet which holds the database.
## AWS Services Used
* VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
* Public Subnets
* Private Subnets
* Databases
* Web Servers
* Application Load Balancers
* Internet Gateway
* Route 53 
## Project Goals
* Set up a three tier architecture
* Deploy an application accessible from a browser
* Demonstrate real-time data access from the database
## Requirements
* An AWS account
## Documentation
* I will be using the official AWS documentation.
