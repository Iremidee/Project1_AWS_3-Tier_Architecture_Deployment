# Project_AWS_3-Tier_Architecture_Deployment
This project is a guide for the process of creating a robust infrastructure consisting of a web tier, application tier, and database tier, leveraging various AWS resources to ensure high availability, security, and performance.
# Project Outline
In this documentation, I will set up and deploy a three tier architecture using AWS. The architecture includes:
1. The First Tier (Web Tier): The public subnet which holds the Application Load Balancer.
2. The Second Tier (App Tier): The private subnet which holds the web servers such as EC2 Instance.
3. The Third Tier (Database Tier): The private subnet which holds the database.
